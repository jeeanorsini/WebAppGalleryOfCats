# CSS Color Markers 🎨

This project was developed to practice fundamental CSS concepts such as gradients, shadows, block alignment, and semantic HTML5 structure.

## 📝 Description

The goal of this project is to visually simulate colored markers (red, green, and blue) using only HTML and CSS — no external images, just pure code.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (gradients, box-shadow, display, reusable classes)

## 💡 Features & Concepts Applied

- Organization using reusable class structures  
- Use of `inline-block` for horizontal layout  
- Gradients created with `linear-gradient`  
- Visual effects with `box-shadow`  
- Color management using `rgb`, `hex`, and `hsl`  
- Centered layout with `margin: auto` and `text-align`  

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern browser.  
3. Watch the magic happen — color markers built with clean code.  

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of a hands-on practice from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design course.  
The goal is to build visual design skills using pure CSS.
